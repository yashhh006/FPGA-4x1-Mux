# FPGA-4x1-Mux

In this project I have made the synthesizable RTL SystemVerilog design code for the 4x1 Mux and realized the RTL design schematic using the Vivado. Further, using the Vivado synthesis tool, and with the help of the lookup table the Synthesized LUT schematic was attained. The RTL design was verified by the separete SytemVerilog testbench.
